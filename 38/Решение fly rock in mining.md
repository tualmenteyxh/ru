## Flyrock Wikipedia
Flyrock,or wild flyrock,is rock that is ejected from the blast site in a controlled explosion in mining operations.The term refers in particular to rock that flies beyond the blast site,causing injuries to people and damage to property.This is considered a significant issue in mining; between 1994 and 2005,32 miners were injured by flyrock.Royex System Safe,Reliable and Low noise rock breaking.The Royex system is a niche product with a natural place in underground and surface quarrying and mining operations.Secondary breaking of oversize and boulder with the benefit of minimizing the risk of fly rock and minimal toxic gas generation is one traditional application.
