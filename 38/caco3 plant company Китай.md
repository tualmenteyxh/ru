## What is the effect of Calcium Carbonate on soil structure
Calcium carbonate is one of the cementing agent the participate in the binding of soil particles together through physico chemical mechanisms and presumbly create a stable soil structure.Naturally occurring bacteria converts CO2 into calcium.A team of Indian scientists have discovered a naturally occurring bacteria that could help fight global warming as it converts CO2 into calcium carbonate (CaCO3) a common compound found as rock.
