## Measuring Relative Permeability in Cores at Reservoir.
To achieve this,nitrogen gas is injected to the core at a low flow rate to overcome capillary pressure.We test the method by measuring two phase water relative permeability in a Berea sandstone core using two gas flow rates: one that is low enough that gravity is a significant driving force for the flow,and a higher flow rate for comparison.Home of the legendary Berea Sandstone Cleveland QuarriesFeaturing Legendary Berea Sandstone.Cleveland Quarries is in the business of quarrying and fabricating sandstone and has the exculsive trademark on Berea Sandstone™.Our legendary Berea Sandstone™ is known for its exceptional durability and strength for use in renovation,restoration,architectural and landscape projects.
