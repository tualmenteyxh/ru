The uniaxial compressive strength of a rock under static loading often decreases with an increasing temperature at which the rock has been heat treated before strength testing.This conclusion is drawn from a great number of experiments [1,2,4,8,9,11,17 19].The higher the temperature is,the lower the strength.Some results for uniaxial compressive strength σ c and tensile strength σ t.Compressive strength of rocks PetroWikiEstimating compressive strength.General rock failure criterion can be reduced to a few parameters dependent on lithology (m) and the uniaxial compressive strength (C 0).Lithology is commonly derived during log analysis,so m may be estimated (Table 1).What is needed still is an initial measure of rock strength provided by C 0.C 0 can be estimated from porosity or sonic velocities,but many.
