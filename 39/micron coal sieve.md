## The Relationship Between Mesh and Micron (μm) Bettersize.
Mesh is the unit to measure the pore size of a sieve,defined as the number of pores per inch in a sieve.The larger the mesh,the smaller the pores.Because the standard in different countries varies,the conversion of mesh to micron is also different.The table below shows the conversion of mesh and micron (for reference only).Testing Sieves HogentoglerThe sieve cloth is mounted without distortion and the joints are smooth to prevent catching of material.Sieves of the same diameter can be nested on top of each other.There is no price difference for full,intermediate,or half height sizes.Sieve certification (calibration) is available at additional cost.

U.S.Mesh Size (or U.S.Sieve Size) is defined as the number of openings in one square inch of a screen.For example,a 36 mesh screen will have 36 openings while a 150 mesh screen will have 150 openings.
