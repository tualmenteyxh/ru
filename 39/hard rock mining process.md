## Hard Rock Mining vs.Placer Gold Mining
Gold is found in two ways; as hard rock sources within ore,and as placer deposits where the gold has separated from its host material.Most prospectors today prefer placer mining because they can use simple tools like gold pans and sluice boxes,but don't overlook hard rock sources either!Crushing in Mineral ProcessingIn mineral processing or metallurgy,the first stage of comminution is crushing.Depending of the type of rock (geometallurgy) to be crushed,there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks.In principle,compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear resistant plate surface.
