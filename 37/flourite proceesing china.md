Fluorite.Fluorite is commercially named fluorspar composed of calcium fluoride (CaF 2).It is the principal source of fluorine.The same is used in production of hydrofluoric acid,which is used in a wide variety of industrial applications including glass etching.Fluorite WikipediaFluorite is a widely occurring mineral that occurs globally with significant deposits in over 9,000 areas.It may occur as a vein deposit,especially with metallic minerals,where it often forms a part of the gangue (the surrounding "host rock" in which valuable minerals occur) and may be associated with galena,sphalerite,barite,quartz,and calcite.
