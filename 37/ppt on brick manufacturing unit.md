## 5 Types of Materials Used in Bricks
Officially,the term brick is used to denote a building unit made of shaped clay,but in modern times it is used to refer to any stone or clay based building unit that is joined with cementitious mortar when used in construction.Typically,bricks are about 4 wide,8 inches long,with a variety of thicknesses.Advantages & Disadvantages of Bricks Civil EngineeringBricks are manufactured in different colors,such as dark red,dark brown,or dull brown,depending on the fire temperature during manufacturing.The firing temperature for brick manufacturing varies from 900°C to 1200°C (1650°F to 2200°F).Uses of Bricks 1.As a Structural Unit
