## Guar gum uses: Industries using guar gum
Jun 23,2010 · Guar gum has a major application in the grass growing and erosion control industry where it is used as a water binder to retain moisture on the soil surface,particularly on slopes where the addition of guar gum to the water systems will help to anchor the hydro seeding mixture to the slopes and seal in the moisture.It is used in systems that protect against hydraulic lift and shear forces.Guar gum uses: Industries using guar gumGuar gum is a white to creamy coloured,free flowing powder and free from extraneous matter.Its ability to suspend solids,bind water by hydrogen bonding,control the viscosity of aqueous solutions and form strong tough films,have accounted for its rapid growth and use in various industries.
