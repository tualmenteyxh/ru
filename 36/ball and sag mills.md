## Calculate and Select Ball Mill Ball Size for Optimum Grinding
In Grinding,selecting (calculate) the correct or optimum ball size that allows for the best and optimum ideal or target grind size to be achieved by your ball mill is an important thing for a Mineral Processing Engineer AKA Metallurgist to do.Often,the ball used in ball mills is oversize "just in case".Well,this safety factor can cost you much in recovery and or mill liner wear and.Autogenous and Semi Autogenous Mills FLSmidthRely on our proven track record of SAG and AG Mill superiority.Since the early 1980s,we have been designing and manufacturing Semi Autogenous (SAG) and Autogenous (AG) Grinding Mills under the Fuller Traylor brand.Semi autogenous grinding uses a minimal ball charge in the range of 6 15% while autogenous grinding uses ore only.
