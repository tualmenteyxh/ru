## The Chemistry and Processing of Jamaican Bauxite
In October,1943,Alcan was incorporated under the name Jamaica Bauxites Limited as a Jamaican company to investigate the commercial potential of Jamaican bauxite.In the same year,2500 tonnes of ore was shipped to the USA for process investigation and it was realised that the bauxite was suitable for processing using Bayer technology.Bayer process extraction of aluminium oxide. Metallurgy.Settling process of aluminium extraction Bayer process In should be noted that the dissolution of the monohydrate requires a temperature of 230C and a time period of 3hr.whereas that of the trihydrate requires a temperature of 180 oC and a time period of 1hr.since bauxite is a mixture of the monohydrate and trihydrate,the temperature used is 180 220 oC and the time period allowed is 2.

## Bauxite tailings Wikipedia
Red mud,or bauxite residue,is a side product of the Bayer process,the principal means of refining bauxite en route to alumina.The resulting alumina is the raw material for producing aluminium by the Hall Héroult process.A typical bauxite plant produces one to two times as much red mud as alumina.Aluminium production processALUMINA PRODUCTION.Bauxite is crushed,dried and ground in special mills where it is mixed with a small amount of water.This process produces a thick paste that is collected in special containers and heated with steam to remove most of the silicon present in bauxites.
