## Working Principle And Characteristics Of Cryogenic Grinder
The Cryogenic Grinding Mill system forms a closed circuit circulation system during the material pulverization process,so that the energy is fully utilized and the energy consumption is saved: the temperature of the chilling source can be reduced to minus 196 degrees,according to the embrittlement temperature of the material.In the pulverization process,the temperature can be adjusted,the.Cryogenic grinding: an independent voiceof the grinding process.An example is the Cryo grind system offered by industrial gas supplier Air Products.How low can you go? Grinding processes using liquid nitrogen fall into two types: temperature controlled grinding and true cryogenic grinding.In the first.
