American.There are four main mining methods: underground,open surface (pit),placer,and in situ mining.Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits.Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits.Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels,beach sands,or other environments.In situ mining.

Open pit mining causes changes to vegetation,soil,and bedrock,which ultimately contributes to changes in surface hydrology,groundwater levels,and flow paths.Additionally,open pit produces harmful pollutants depending on the type of mineral being mined,and the type of mining.An Introduction To Surface MiningSurface mining is often preferred to subsurface mining by companies in the industry because it is less expensive,there are fewer complications with electricity and water,and it is safer.However,surface mining can be more environmentally damaging than subsurface mining.Types of Surface Mining Open Pit Mining
