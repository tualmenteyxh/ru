Saying a catalyst 'speeds up' the reaction is a bit ambiguous.A catalyst increases the rate of reaction (reactions second),but not necessarily the 'speed' in the sense of the time it takes for the reactant molecules to become product molecules.Not all molecules have the same velocity energy.Some will be moving faster,some slower.Roads to the Great War: The Haber Process in War and PeaceMar 25,2018 · Sounds simple,but the process proved to be complicated,involving a pressure vessel and a metal catalyst,originally osmium (Os),which is the densest element and not abundant.Later research by Carl Bosch (1874 1940) of BASF led to the satisfactory substitution of iron compounds,particularly magnetite (Fe3O4),which dramatically reduced.
