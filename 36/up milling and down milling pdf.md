## Introduction to Milling Tools and Their Application
Introduction to Milling Tools and their Application Identification and application of cutting tools for milling The variety of cutting tools available for modern CNC milling centers makes it imperative for machine operators to be familiar with different types of milling cutters and how they are applied to everyday milling processes.Face millingApply down milling for favourable chip formation,i.e.thick to thin chip;.Face milling with a very high feed per tooth (up to 4 mm tooth) is possible when using cutters that have small entering angles or when using round insert cutters,due to their chip thinning effect.Although the depth of cut is limited to less than 2.8 mm,the extreme.
