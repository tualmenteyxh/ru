## Greenland has the potential to supply 30% of the world's.
In 2011 the European parliament was given a paper showing Greenland is home to the largest deposit of rare earth elements in the world; this is based on estimates that the deposit beneath the ice and rocks of the Ilimaussaq intrusion on Greenland's south western shore could supply as much as 25% of REE world demand for the next 50 years.
