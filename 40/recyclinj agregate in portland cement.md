## Aggregates cement
Aggregates are inert granular materials such as sand,gravel,or crushed stone that,along with water and portland cement,are an essential ingredient in concrete.For a good concrete mix,aggregates need to be clean,hard,strong particles free of absorbed chemicals or coatings of clay and other fine materials that could cause the.Recycled waste glass as fine aggregate replacement in.Poon and Chan partially replaced recycled concrete aggregate which used as aggregate in concrete blocks with 10% of different waste materials.These materials were 5% crushed tile combined with 5% waste glass (5T5G) and 4% crushed brick with 4% waste glass combined with 2% crushed tile (4B4G2T).
