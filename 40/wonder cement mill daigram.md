## Coal Mill an overview ScienceDirect Topics
To summarize the coal mill controls,they may be divided basically into two major categories:.1.To control the quality of coal being sent to the burners located on the furnace walls.The word quality here means the temperature and fineness of the PF.The set temperature values are dependent on the percentage of volatile matter that exists in the main fuel.Cement Manufacturing A Wet Process with the Flow DiagramCEMENT MANUFACTURING A WET PROCESS WITH THE FLOW DIAGRAM.In the wet process,1) The raw limestone from quarries is first crushed to small size fragments.Then it is mixed with clay or shale in ball or tube mill and ground to form a slurry of a fine consistency with the addition of water.
